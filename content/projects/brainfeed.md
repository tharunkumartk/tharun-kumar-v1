## Project Overview

Brainfeed represents the future of personalized news consumption. In an era of information overload, this iOS application leverages sophisticated AI algorithms to deliver hyper-personalized news summaries from reputable sources.

## The Technology Behind Brainfeed

### Multi-Armed Bandit Recommendation System
The core of Brainfeed's personalization lies in its multi-armed bandit recommendation engine. This algorithm continuously learns from user interactions, optimizing content delivery to match individual preferences and reading patterns.

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built with SwiftUI for a native iOS experience
- **Backend**: Powered by TypeScript and Node.js for robust server-side processing
- **Database**: Firestore on Google Cloud Platform for scalable data storage
- **AI/ML**: Pinecone vector database for semantic content matching and recommendations

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Summarization**: AI-powered news summaries that capture the essence of articles
- **Personalized Feed**: Content tailored to individual reading preferences
- **Source Credibility**: Only aggregates from verified, reputable news sources
- **Real-time Learning**: Adapts to user behavior for improved recommendations

## Development Journey

Building Brainfeed involved tackling several complex challenges:

1. **Content Curation**: Implementing algorithms to identify and filter high-quality news sources
2. **Personalization Engine**: Developing a recommendation system that balances exploration vs exploitation
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Creating a seamless iOS experience with fast loading and intuitive navigation
4. **Scalability**: Designing the backend architecture to handle growing user bases and content volume

## Impact and Future

Brainfeed is currently available on TestFlight, where early users are experiencing the power of truly personalized news consumption. The app represents a significant step toward solving information overload while maintaining journalistic integrity.

**Try it yourself**: Brainfeed is available on TestFlight for iOS devices.
