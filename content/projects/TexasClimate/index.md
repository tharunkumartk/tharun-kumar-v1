During the winter of '21, Texas had an unexpected winter surge that shattered nearly all power infrastructure throughout Texas. This catastrophic event prompted me to find a more promising solution to Texas's aging power grid. I constructed a Machine Learning model that analyzed climate data across Texas to construct a regionalized renewable power-grid. If implemented, the project would decrease Texas carbon emmissions by nearly 40%.
