During my high school years, I developed a neural network-based mood analysis algorithm that detects human emotion from conversation text. This project involved training machine learning models on large-scale Reddit data to analyze user sentiment and emotional patterns.

The system uses natural language processing techniques with NLTK for text preprocessing and Keras for building deep learning models. By leveraging the Reddit API, I was able to gather diverse conversational data to train robust sentiment analysis models.
