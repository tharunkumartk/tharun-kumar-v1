Our future is in drones.

For the past week, I have been working with drones; I implemented a variety of object/facial detection algorithms for the drone to effectively follow a face without any remote control. My purpose for exploring usages of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence is because I am a part of a district-wide non-profit known as Frisco Ignite, where I will be giving a speech to hundreds of middle/elementary schoolers across the district about technology. I decided to discuss the topic of drones to engage the young students into the fields of STEM early-on, and throughout my research of how drones are used today, I made discoveries of use-cases that I couldn't even imagine.

## The Power of Drone Technology

From delivering medical supplies to tracking animals in ecosystems, drones are an essential part of humanity's future. While exploring how to integrate Python's OpenCV computer vision algorithms, I came up with a variety of Final Product ideas dealing with the drone.

## My Vision: 3D Facial Mapping

My primary idea is to utilize a drone's camera to circle around any face it detects, and create a 3D representation of their facial features. Its purpose could be security in corporate buildings, or even just home-security to identify any potential threats. The drone's easy maneuverability means that the human its analyzing is not required to move whatsoever; they can be minding their own business, and the drone will pick up the facial features, identifying the person.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to further research the topic and continue exploring how drones can revolutionize the way we approach security, identification, and countless other applications that we haven't even imagined yet.
