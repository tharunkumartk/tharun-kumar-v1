summary: "Analyzing Texas climate data through machine learning to design a regionalized renewable power grid. Inspired by the devastating 2021 winter storm, this research explores solutions that could reduce carbon emissions by 40%."

Following the devastating 2021 Texas winter storm that left millions without power, I embarked on a climate analysis project to explore how data science could help design more resilient renewable energy systems.

Using Python with Pandas for data manipulation, Requests for API integration, and Plotly for interactive visualizations, I developed machine learning models to analyze Texas climate patterns. The goal was to design a regionalized renewable power grid that could better withstand extreme weather events while significantly reducing carbon emissions.

The analysis revealed that strategic placement of renewable energy sources based on historical climate data could potentially reduce carbon emissions by 40% while improving grid reliability during extreme weather events.
